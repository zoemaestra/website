            <p class="blogpost">These cookies are my go-to if I want to bring treats to parties and events with friends. They don't miss and they don't even require an annoying website banner that you have to dismiss.</p>
            <p class="blogpost"><h3>Ingredients - makes ~16 cookies</h3></p>
            <p class="blogpost"> For the dough:
                <ul>
                    <li>100g butter or baking margarine (I use Stork)</li>
                    <li>100g caster sugar</li>
                    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                    <li>200g self-raising flour</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="blogpost"> For the coating:
                <ul>
                    <li>Approx. 4 tablespoons demerara/turbinado sugar</li>
                    <li>Approx. 1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="blogpost"><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
            <p class="blogpost">Preheat oven to 170C/325F.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Mix butter and sugar together until creamy.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Add egg yolks, one at a time and mix in well between.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Add cinnamon, mix in well before adding the honey and mixing in well.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Add the flour and mix in. You don't really need to sift it beforehand.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">The dough should be moldable without being dry and falling apart. You should be able to form a sphere without cracks with the dough in the palm of your hand.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Partition the dough into however many cookies you want to make. This recipe makes 16 large ones, but you could probably get 20 smaller ones.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Take a lump of the dough, and form it into a ball in your hand. You don't want it to be all cracked up, so try and make sure it's nice and smooth.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">In a plate, add the sugar and cinnamon for coating and mix them together. You don't have to use coarse sugar like demerara/turbinado, but it adds so much texturally so I really recommend it.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Roll the dough ball in the sugar dusting and once fully coated, press it down on one side to make it puck shaped with a thumb divot in the middle. Flip it over and do the same on the other side so the sugar gets pressed into it.</p>

            <p class="blogpost">Put onto baking tray lined with baking paper. You can fit about 8 onto a tray the size of mine if you stagger them a bit so they dont touch once cooked.</p>
            <p class="blogpost">Bake for 12-18 minutes until golden. Leave to cool on the tray until they're cooled off and solid enough to pick up and eat!</p>
